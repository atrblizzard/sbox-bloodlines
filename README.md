## Goal
It's aimed to be the spiritual successor of Project Vaulderie but developed for [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news). The goal of this project is to replicate the vanilla VTM:B experience with some quality of life thrown in thanks to Source 2's modding capability.

## Features
* Quest System
* Dialog System
* Entities recreated for Source 2
* Initial VData structure created
* Basic VR Support

## Planned Updates
* Adapt [FPS SDK Base](https://github.com/AmperSoftware/TF-Source-2/tree/dev/code/Libraries/FPS) for multiplayer base
* Weapon system
* Cinematic animations (scriptabd sequence with multiple actors)
